##  Attire
Wear anything you are comfortable in; no jackets  required.  DC is a humid swamp for the month of August so wear breathable fabrics and be ready to boogie. Ladies can be comforable in a sundress and gentlemen rock yacht casual: a button-down and shorts.

## Food and Drink
Jess and Ed's favorite food is breakfast food so we will have a fine buffet of eggs, french toast, bacon, and other delicious bites. We will have breakfast cocktails made with the finest of DC spirits, plus beer and wine since it's five o'clock somewhere.

## After-Party
Join the bride and groom at their favorite watering hole in DC: The Boundary Stone on [1st and Rhode Island Ave NW](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Boundary+Stone/@38.9152449,-77.0126794,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x94cd67fbe4f05946?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj2xcPWqb7VAhWHy4MKHW8ACW0Q_BIIkAEwEQ).
