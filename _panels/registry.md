##  Registry
Jess and Ed have lived together for 3 years and have accumulated plenty of crap. We have a few gift ideas from our favorite store: Amazon, that are definitely not crap.

##  Something sweet (or savory)
If you don't want to get us a boring set of towels you can you can bestow us with consumable gifts like wine, cheese, coffee, or more wine.  We will be traveling for our honeymoon from August 12 to August 19 so make sure you don't send anything during that period or we'll come home to fat, drunk rats.

## Honeyfund

We are going to Austin, TX and Joshua Tree National Park for our honeymoon so you can buy us dinner or some sunscreen for our first journey as newly weds.
